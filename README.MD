This was a project in 2016 or 2017 where we needed to search for expired AWS access keys (90 days and older, with 10 days of grace time)  and report to the users and managers that those keys which are expired will be renewed and will be emaild to the user, in case they do not do so within a 10 day period. 
This is when I started my Python learning and will let you make modifications if you see a fit anywhere in the code, 
I love this code, where from time to time I look and see my mistakes and where I can improve my code skills.

I was and am proud of this code. 
I have a lot more Python code since then, to manipulate multiple AWS applications and resources. You can contact me for anythin you might need and if I have it, I will upload it here for your use.

This works great in AWS environment, change the region, account and the user in order to run locally on your laptop.
