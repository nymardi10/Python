This was a project in 2016 or 2017 where we needed to search for expired AWS access keys and report to the users and managers that those keys which are expired will be renewed and will be emaild to the user, in case they do not do so within a 10 day period.

This works great in AWS environment, change the region, account and the user in order to run locally on your laptop.
